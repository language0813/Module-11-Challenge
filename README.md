# Module-11-Challenge

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

- With what I learned in the class and the provided hints in the starter file, I was able to extract Titles and Preview text successfully by using tools like Splinter and BeautifulSoup.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

- The most challenging part is to calculate how many terrestrial (Earth) days are in a Martian year for question 5. The ChatGPT and Github links below were helpful resources that provided the idea for finding the answer.

- I was able to finish the rest whth the course material. This homework was both fun and challenging, as it required applying concepts learned in previous modules, such as Pandas and Data Visualization.
